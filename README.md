# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2018-Labo-DockerMusic

## Admin

* Every student must do the implementation and have a repo with the code at the end of the process (to acquire the skills).
* It is up to you if you want to fork this repo, or if you prefer to work in a private repo. However, you have to use exactly the same directory structure for the validation procedure to work. 
* ** There will be no grade for this lab. However, if you work on it seriously, the next challenge will be very easy (just be careful: the challenge will be done on a short period, so don't be late!)**
* We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on telegram or in the forum, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.
 
## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

* The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

* The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

* The third objective is to continue practicing with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in the previous lecture). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

* Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.


## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

* the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

* the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound         |
|------------|---------------|
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`    |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`       |
| `flute`    | `trulu`       |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`     |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum`   |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

* The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
* After accepting a connection request, the auditor should send a JSON payload containing the list of active musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab


You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 10 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician drum
```
When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.


## Task 1: design the application architecture and protocols

| #  | Topic |
| --- | --- |
|Question | How can we represent the system in an **architecture diagram**, which gives information both about the Docker containers, the communication protocols and the commands? |
| | ![image](images/architecture2.png) |
|Question | Who is going to **send UDP datagrams** and **when**? |
| | Every musicians, every seconds |
|Question | Who is going to **listen for UDP datagrams** and what should happen when a datagram is received? |
| | The auditor, he have to display the message received, add the musician in an array if doesn't exist in it |
|Question | What **payload** should we put in the UDP datagrams? |
| | the payload will be the unique ID and the instrument that the musician plays |
|Question | What **data structures** do we need in the UDP sender and receiver? When will we update these data structures? When will we query these data structures? |
| | An array on the auditor, this array will contains all musicians that played since last 5 seconds. The array content will be sent to the TCP server client |


## Task 2: implement a "musician" Node.js application

|Question | What is **npm**?
| | is the node packet manager, that will install all packet that we need
|Question | What is the `npm install` command and what is the purpose of the `--save` flag?
| | npm install will check the package.json and install all dependancies, the --save flag will set npm to include the package inside the dependencies section of the package.json
|Question | How can we use the `https://www.npmjs.com/` web site?
| | we can use it to search any package we need to use them in our nodejs app !
|Question | In JavaScript, how can we **generate a UUID** compliant with RFC4122?
| | yes we can ! https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid

| | docker ps -a
|Question | How do we **stop/kill** one running container?
| | docker stop [CONTAINER_NAME]
|Question | How can we check that our running containers are effectively sending UDP datagrams?
| | with wireshark ? -> with filter : udp.port == 2205        ip.addr == 239.240.241.255


## Task 4: implement an "auditor" Node.js application

## Task 5: package the "auditor" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic
| ---  | ---
|Question | How do we validate that the whole system works, once we have built our Docker image?
| | start the validate.sh script with Docker Terminal


## Docker step by step !
```
#on cr√©e l'image Docker de l'auditeur
$ cd image-auditor/
$ docker build -t res/auditor .

#on cr√©e l'image Docker du musicien
$ cd ../image-musician/
$ docker build -t res/musician .

#on start deux musiciens
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute

#on start l'auditeur
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor

#dans un autre terminal
#on r√©cup√©re le tableau de musiciens actifs
telnet 192.168.99.100 2205

```

## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

* the Docker image names
* the names of instruments and their sounds
* the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should try to run it.
